                    Using data on the universe of Chinese export transactions in 2006, 
					we document that, conditional on the number of products each firm exports, 
					lower-ranking products are more sensitive to distance. This fact is inconsistent 
					with standard models but can be explained in a model with increasing marginal cost
					of production. This assumption implies that the market share of productive firms is
					lower, and more unproductive firms enter. Moderate variable trade costs consistent
					with the observed level of tariffs generate a much larger and non-constant trade 
					elasticity, even when productivity is distributed according to an untruncated 
					Pareto distribution. We find that if expanding the production scale by one 
					log point increases marginal cost by 25%, then welfare gains from trade are 2%, 
					compared to 12% under the constant marginal cost assumption.

                    When demand for products and services drops during recessions, employers decrease 
					labor inputs by cutting either or both of workers and hours. If pre-recession hours 
					were excessive, cutting hours might increase labor productivity, given an 
					inverted-U-shaped hours-productivity profile; less exhaustion implies
					higher effort-per-hour. This effect is amplified in team settings, where labor 
					reallocation leads to hours being concentrated among the top performers after 
					total hours are cut. The adjustment process is examined using single-firm data
					on Japanese construction design projects. A Ricardian model is proposed, and
					its parameters calibrated with data to quantify the model's predictions. 
					Regression results derived from the actual data are consistent with the 
					model's predictions. Specifically, in response to the hours decrease
					resulting from the 2008-2009 global financial crisis: (1) total productivity 
					improves by more than the increase in individual productivity, the labor share 
					becomes more concentrated, and team size decreases;
					(2) the productivity improvement is greater for larger teams and less productive 
					teams; (3) larger teams exhibit lower average productivity because weaker workers 
					join teams when more hours are needed than the stars can handle. Within-team labor
					allocation, and its cyclical responses, have not been addressed in
					the literature. The analysis is important given the prevalence of team production, 
					and it provides deeper insight into the nature of organizations' cyclical 
					adjustments of labor inputs.

                We introduce variable marginal costs of exporting in a heterogeneous firms trade
				model à la Melitz (2003) to match data on the frequency of shipment of exporters,
				which, potentially, is a source of additional information on the costs of trade. In our
				setup, the marginal costs of exporting depend on the quantity shipped in addition to
				the standard iceberg trade costs. This costs structure can be micro-found through a
				firm’s inventory management problem. Under a Pareto distribution of firms’ 
				productivities, our model implies a tractable gravity equation as well as an 
				expression for
				welfare gains from trade, for which the regular gravity equation and the Arkolakis
				et al. (2012, ACR) formula for gains from trade are special cases. Relative to the ACR
				formula, our expression for the gains from trade additionally depends on the elasticity 
				of trade costs with respect to traded quantity and implies lower gains from trade.
				We apply a version of our model with a log-normal distribution of firms’ productivities
				to data on transactions of Chinese exporters. Compared to a model with constant
				marginal costs of exporting, our model implies a lower distance elasticity of iceberg
				trade costs but a higher distance elasticity of fixed exporting costs.

                Using detailed project management records from the design department in a large
				Japanese architectural & engineering consultancy firm, we estimate the manager 
				effects on the project profitability. One standard deviation increase in unobserved 
				manager ability increases the profitability by 6 percentage points. Based on 
				interviews with seven project managers, we hypothesize that managers improve team 
				performance by better planning, better communication with both client and project 
				members and better understanding of the client's needs and decision-making style, 
				which all help to front-load design work, reduce waiting time, and avoid wasteful 
				redesigning. We provide supporting evidence from the analyses of labor input data,
				and three-hundred-sixty-degree evaluation records. Especially, we find that the speed 
				of project execution, quality of communication with subordinates, and degree centrality
				in the internal network could be important mediating factors.
