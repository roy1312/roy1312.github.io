                   When output demand drops during recessions, employers decrease labor inputs by 
				   cutting workers and/or hours. If pre-recession hours were excessive, cutting hours 
				   might increase labor productivity, given an inverted-U-shaped hours-productivity 
				   profile. When total hours decrease in team settings, labor reallocation causes hours 
				   to be concentrated among top performers. The adjustment process is examined using 
				   single-firm Japanese data on construction design projects. A theoretical model is 
				   proposed and calibrated to analyze within-team labor allocation. We find that in 
				   response to the hours decrease resulting from the 2008-2009 global financial crisis: 
				   (1) total productivity improves by more than the increase in individual productivity, 
				   the labor share becomes more concentrated, and team size decreases; 
				   (2) the productivity improvement is greater for larger teams and less productive 
				   teams; (3) larger teams exhibit lower average productivity because weaker workers 
				   join teams when more hours are needed than the stars can handle.
